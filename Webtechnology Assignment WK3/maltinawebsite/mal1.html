						As part of our commitment to our corporate philosophy of "Winning with Nigeria",
						 Nigerian Breweries Plc has continued to take an increasingly active part in supporting education, 
						 amongst our other CSR focus point. <br>
						As testament to this, we set up the Nigerian Breweries-Felix 
						Ohiwerei Education Trust Fund in 1994 with a startup capital of 100 million Naira 
						to enable sustained quality education through structured intervention in the sector. <br>
						The fund has footprints across the six geographical zones in Nigeria at primary, secondary and tertiary
						 levels of education. Through the Fund, we have constructed and furnished over 400 classrooms, 
						 sanitary facilities and libraries in 74 communities across the country. We have also granted 
						 scholarships to deserving students in tertiary institutions. <br>
						In 2015, the fund introduced the Maltina Teacher of the Year, a national competition to identify, honor
						 and reward outstanding teachers in Nigeria. <br>
						Maltina Teacher of the Year which has recognised a total of 181 teachers since inception,
						 is supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and other stakeholders in education including
						  the Nigeria Union of Teachers(NUT), All Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary Schools 
						  (ANCOPPS) and Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN).
